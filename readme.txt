A plugin for adding input fields to the WooCommerce Checkout Block.

== Description ==

**Basically, it is a checkout field editor plugin, but for the WooCommerce block checkout**

The WooCommerce block checkout can be edited directly from the Gutenberg editor (open the "WP Admin -> Pages -> Checkout" for editing). By default WooCommerce allows adding only Paragraph/Image/Separator inner blocks to the checkout block. The **SilkyPress Input Field Block** plugin lets you add inner blocks with a custom input field to the checkout block.

The plugin creates a block, called `Input Field`, which can be added to an inner block of the `Checkout Block`. One instance of the block will add one custom field to the checkout form. The block can be added as many times as necessary to the `Checkout Block` and can be inserted more than one time within the same inserter place of the `Checkout Block`.

### Input Field block **settings**

After adding an `Input Field` inner block to the checkout block, you can change its settings in the `Block Inpector` on the right side of the editor. Within the settings `General` tab you can set its:
- Field type (`Text`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Radio` or `Textarea`)
- Label
- Id
- Default value
- Help text

### Input Field **validation** on the frontend

In the `Validation` tab you can toggle the input field as to be required or optional. On the frontend, if a required input field is left empty by the customer, then, upon clicking the **Place Order** button, the `Please fill this field` error message will be shown.

### **Storing the value** of the Input Field

After clicking the **Place Order** button, the value of the `Input Field` will be saved to the database as a custom field associated with the order.

In the `Presentation` tab of the `Input Field` block's settings you can enable:
- the `Show on Order page` option so that the field's value will show up on the `Edit Order` page in the admin
- the `Show on Order Confirmation` option so that the field's value will show up on the customer's `Order Confirmation` page (formally known as `Thank You` page)
- the `Show on Order Email` option so that the field's value will show up in the email the customer receives after placing the order.
